Pop Quiz

A website with a quiz to test your knowledge.


This assignment is unfinished because of bad timing so a third of it, javascript, is not complete. 

the idea is to have the user be able to click on the start button in the middle which would change the screen to start the quiz.

once the button is clicked, the quiz would start.
A new window would pop up with a boz in the middle of the screen with a timer, a questions, answers to choose from, amount of questions, and a next button.

The idea was to have the timer go off and countdown, prompting you to answer one of the questions. When you click on one of the questions it'll show if you got it correct or not. Once you clicked, you'll be able to hit the button towards the next question.

When you answer all the questions or you run out of time, you will be taken towards the next screen where you will be able to see your score and you'll be able to add your initials for your score.

When you hit next you'll be taken to the leaderboard window, where you'll be able to see your score and be able to start over the quiz by clicking the button.

As said in the beginning, this assignment isn't finished due to timing, but I would want to come back and try to finish it later in the future.
